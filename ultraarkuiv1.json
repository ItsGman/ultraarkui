All supply drops have element in them.\n\nThe shop is located on the Discord server, join it to link your Discord account.\n\nA tutorial on how to link your account and use the ingame shop is posted on the Discord server.\n\nMax wild is 700, perfect tame is 1050. Tames bought from the shop are max level.\n\nMaximum tribe size is 10. You can use the AA Turret Genie to fill turrets quickly. You can use the AA Medical Station to heal tames quickly.\n\nWipe schedule, supply drop loot tables, and player punishments are all posted on the Discord.\n\nDo boss fights at your own risk, they are known to occasionally be buggy. Don't do bossfights near a regularly scheduled wild dino wipe. Lost items will not be restored, only take what you are willing to lose.\n\nTransferring between servers can be buggy, transfer at your own risk and be cautious. Large stacks of items (over 100k) almost always cause issues. Some items like the Dino Painter and Net Projectile are not transferable. Items lost due to transferring will not be restored.",

                    "text1": "R1 • No teaming with another tribe to raid someone or defend from a raid. Your tribe cannot join in on someone else's raid unless you raid their FOB first. If you counter raid you need to make reasonable efforts to raid the initial raiders and successfully clear them out before raiding the original target. Punishment for blatant teaming is a removal of both FOBs and a warning issued to both tribes. Punishment for joining in on a raid as a third-party will result in the removal of the third-party raider's FOB and a warning.\n\nR2 • When raiding, your tribe cannot have more than 5 soaker type tames soaking at once. Your tribe can have no more than 10 total tames of any type getting shot by turrets at once. Punishment for this rule can range from the involved tames being deleted and a warning issued, up to a permanent ban depending on severity and damages caused.\n\nR3 • Your FOB cannot be left abandoned for longer than 8 hours. If you finish a raid or intend to quit raiding, you need to unpower (destroy all generators and power off all turrets) and/or remove your FOB. Punishment for either of these is a warning and admin removal of your FOB.\n\nR4 • Don't destroy or move/upload/transfer your loot if you are being raided. Punishment for first offense is a 2 week ban. Second offense is a permanent ban.\n\nR5 • Abusing bugs within the game to raid people unfairly is not allowed. Punishment can range from a warning to permanent ban depending on severity and damages.\n\nR6 • Platform saddle tames cannot be fully covered for raiding, they must have at least one exposed side. Raft raiding is allowed. Punishment is a warning and deletion of the tame.",

Punishment for breaking this rule is a structure wipe.\n\nB2 • No structure spam that is not near an active FOB or base. No excessive structure spam. Spam should be limited to 40 foundations from the your base, FOB, or nearest tower.\n\nB3 • All base spots must be accessible through normal means. Spots that require bed/chair, teleporting, grapple glitching, meshing, tame glitching, or any sort of bug abuse are subject to admin removal without warning.\n\nB4 • Don't build turrets at spawn areas unless they are attached to a base. Don't build turrets out in the open anywhere unless they are protecting a teleporter, part of an active FOB, or part of your base. Punishment is removal of turrets and potential for a warning depending on severity.\n\nB5 • Don't build on or block off any of the obelisk terminals, with the exception of blue obelisk on The Island and red obelisk on Scorched Earth. This includes leaving tames on aggressive. The punishment for this is an admin structure wipe or tame deletion.\n\nB6 • Platform saddle tames cannot be fully covered, they must have at least one exposed side. Punishment is a warning and deletion of the tame.\n\nB7 • Don't intentionally place structures in the mesh. All meshed structures are subject to admin removal, unintentional or not. Intentionally building inside of the mesh will lead to a permanent ban. If you believe there are meshed structures preventing you from building, you can use the Structure Locator :structurelocator: (crafted in your inventory) to find where they are. You can make a mesh removal ticket if the normal methods of removal don't work. If you discover a base fully within the mesh, make a player/tribe report ticket.",
